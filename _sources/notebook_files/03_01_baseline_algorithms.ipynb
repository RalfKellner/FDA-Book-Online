Assuming all features are standardized, the feature with the biggest weight $w_j$ is most important for the probability prediction of $\\pi_i$ and $(1 - \\pi_i)$, respectively. Note that we can analyze the impact of a change in the features directly on the probability prediction for $\\pi_i$, however, the size of the weights must not be interpreted as for the linear regression model because the relationship between features and the probability prediction is not linear. This can be made clear when looking again at the sigmoid function in the figure above. Non-linear means that an increase in the feature differs regarding what the current value is. In the figure you can see that the value of the sigmoid function changes to a higher degree if $z$ changes in the area around the origin, while a change for very low or high values of $z$ hardly have an effect of the value for the sigmoid function. On the contrary, if a linear relationship exists, the dependent variable always changes to the same degree, no matter where the change of the independent variable occurs.\n",

As we are more interested in a general statement, we derive this sensitivity for every data point and average for the $j-$th feature over all observations $i = 1, ..., m$.

    "If the task is to analyze a categorical target variable with more than two outcomes, we have multiple options. Traditional regression methods like multinomial or ordinary regression or more flexible approaches like neural networks. We will not discuss these methods in detail at this point, however, simply try to apply the idea which has been used to adjust the linear regression algorithm to a binary target variable. As before if $Y_i$ has multiple categories we can not make predictions by Equation <a href=\"#mjx-eqn-linear_regression\">1</a> which results in arbitrary values in $\\mathbb{R}$. For the binary classification, the regression line was transformed to return probabilities for the categories. As we had only two categories, it was enough to define the probability for $P(Y_i = 1)$ because this also defines the probability $P(Y_i = 0) = 1 - P(Y_i = 1)$. If $Y_i$ has more than two categories, this idea needs to be extended, i.e., with $K$ categories at least $K-1$ probabilities need to be determined or we simply model a probability for each category. Given $n$ feature variables we could set up an equation system in which we use one equation for each category $k = 1, ..., K$:\n",

    "Note that for each category, feature values are the same, but the weights and biases differ. For the equations above $Z_k$ can have arbitrary values and we want probabilities for $P(Y_i = k) = \\pi_{ki}, k = 1, ..., K$.

Now, to make sure that the sum of probabilities for disjoint events sums up to one, we need a normalization for each $e^{Z_k}$. This is solved by summing over all $e^{Z_k}$ values which we denote by $\\sum_j e^{z_j}$. Assume, we have three categories and three values $z_1 = -1.0, z_2 = 0.7, z_3 = 0.2$. Using the $e$-function, this leads to $e^{z_1} = 0.3679, e^{z_2} = 2.0138, e^{z_3} = 1.2214$, all values are now greater than $0$. To determine the normalization, we add up: $e^{z_1} + e^{z_2} + e^{z_3} = 0.3679 + 2.0138 + 1.2214 = 3.6031$. Using this in the denominator, it results:\n",

    "What can we learn from these algorithms to generate a general understanding of supervised learning models? You may already have noticed a repeating pattern when reading each subsection. Every algorithm has an affine function, $\\boldsymbol{w}^T \\boldsymbol{X}_{i} + b$, as a building block. For every algorithm, the affine function gets transformed with another function $g$. The purpose of this transformation is to bring the predicted variable on the scale which is needed for the learning problem, i.e., the scale of the target variable. Once the algorithm is specified, model parameters are estimated by minimizing a loss function. The loss function is chosen according to the learning problem. The table below summarizes this structure of the models:\n",
