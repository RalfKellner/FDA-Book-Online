    "\n",
    "Using Python for data analysis can be done in various ways. Python is an interpreted general-purpose programing language and all you basically need to execute python is an interpreter which can translate between the machine and you speaking in Python. However, especially for beginners, I recommend to install a complete Python distribution which manages the installation and use of Python. More specifically, I recommend to download and install the Anaconda package manager ([follow this link!](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)) which will not only install Python, but many software and language tools that can be helpful for analyzing data. Depending on your operation system, choose the appropriate installer and follow its guidance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once your installation is finished, you can open the Anaconda Navigator as explained [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) and make sure that Juypter Notebook is installed, if not, you should do so. After Jupyter Notebook is installed, you may start it from the Anaconda Navigator menu or directly open a terminal and type \"jupyter notebook\". After that, you should see something like this cell:\n",

    "...and the above should happen. A recommendation is to work with shortcuts right from the start. Click somewhere except in the cell and press \"h\". An overview with keyboard shortcuts and corresponding actions should occur. For instance, we can press \"b\" if we are not inside a cell to generate a new cell below the current cell and if we are inside a cell when pressing \"control + Enter\" (at least on MacOS). Jupyter notebook does not only offer to execute code, we can also write plain text, math equations and many more if we convert the cell to markdown format. To learn more about markdown [you can read this](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).

    "## Functions\n",
    "When we want to execute the same task multiple times, we can define a function to do the job and save us some time and code. Functions are a sequence of instructions performing a task bundled in a unit. You already saw some built-in function like *type*, *len* or *del* which perform the tasks of showing the object type, the number of elements in an object or to delete the object. Luckily, python also gives us the opportunity to define our own functions, if we want to perform some tasks which are not captured by existing functions. To define a function, we use the keyword 'def' which is following by a function-name that we choose and round brackets. After the brackets a colon follows with a linebreak. The so called body is defined in an indented list of instructions. Functions can handle input and are able to output results (both is optional). Let us define the *add_two*-function which adds a value of $2$ to an input variable x and returns the result."

    "## Object Orientation\n",
    "As stated earlier, almost everythin in Python is an object, but what does that mean? Objects typically include different types of information, more concrete attributes and methods. We also have seen that different types of objects exists, e.g. integer numbers, strings, floating numbers, so even an integer of $2$ is not the same as the integer $3$ it is the same type. This is why we can add or multiply these two numbers, but we can not add a string \"hello\" to the integer $2$. Behind these observations stands the concept of object orientation. Objects of the same type follow the same blueprint and objects of different types have different blueprints. The blueprint is called a class in programing. A class is the prototype for objects of the same type. It is not important for the task of data analysis to be an expert in object oriented programing, but it is useful for better understanding some functionalities when working with data analysis applications at a later stage. However, I try to be brief at this point and may omit some information. We directly take a look at an example of a class called *Student* that we define to gather some fundamental knowledge for classes and objects in Python. Regarding its syntax, a class definition looks similar to the definition of a function. The definition starts with *class* and the class name we choose. The content of the class is defined in the indented body. Typically, objects of a class have certain attributes and methods. In Python attributes can be assigned when an object is created on the basis of a class definition, so at initialization. This is handled by the initialization method, which is a special function, called a **magic method** in Pyhton (for the moment, you do not need to care what magic methods are). An important keyword here is self, which simply means we refer to the instance that is created by the class. Typically, self comes first when defining class methods. Ok, but now let us make this concrete and learn from the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to define the class \"Student\" which should contain information regarding the subject, the age and the registration number. These are attributes. Furthermore, we define a method which enables the student to say hello."

The existence of user-friendly, high-quality packages for data analysis. Imagine, we want to use two functions, the say-hello- and the say-goodby-function, for all our analysis. Instead of defining these to functions for every analysis, we can define them in one script and import this script for each of our analyses. The script is called a **module** and is a collection of statements and definitions. For instance, write the following code in a text editor of your choice and save it with the \".py\" ending (not the \".ipynb\" ending of jupyter notebook files) in the directory of your default anaconda directory under the name \"my_module.py\"."

    "Modules can have submodules with a nested structure. A collection of modules with a certain structure is called a **package** and this is were it gets very interesting for Python users. A multitude of packages exists including an immense amount of efficiently written methods for various tasks. For us, very important packages are [numpy](https://numpy.org/) among others offering a broad range of calculus methods, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data handling, [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning methods, [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for deep learning, [plotly](https://plotly.com/) for interactive visualization or [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for static visualization. All packages exhibit a good documentation and are worth exploring, however, in my experience, the best ways of learning the usage of these packages is to do this with a hands-on-approach which we will follow during the course. If you installed Anaconda, a few of these packages are installed with the Python base package. However, you may encounter situations in which you need to install external packages. Packages are managed by online repositories, i.e. Conda or Pypi. If you want to install a package from one of these repositories, the best way is to open the terminal and type *conda* (or *pip*) and the package name. Further options can be used for installation, but this is not too important in the beginning. For more information see [this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/installing-with-conda.html). To give you an idea, how we will work with packages, we close this chapter with an example which shows you how to import the package numpy and use it to define two matrices and multiply these two. "
